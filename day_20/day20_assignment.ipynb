    "    So far from sounding and discovery,\n",
    "    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\n",
    "    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\n",
    "    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\n",

    "    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.\n",

    "    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\n",
    "    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)\n",
    "    A sleeping potion; which so took effect\n",
    "    As I intended, for it wrought on her\n",
    "    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\n",

    "    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\n",
    "    All this I know, and to the marriage\n",
    "    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this\n",
    "    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\n",

    "\n",
    "  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\n",
    "    And then in post he came from Mantua\n",
    "    To this same place, to this same monument.\n",
    "    This letter he early bid me give his father,\n",

    "\n",
    "  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\n",
    "    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\n",
    "    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\n",
    "    And by-and-by my master drew on him;\n",
    "    And then I ran away to call the watch.\n",
    "\n",

    "    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,\n",
